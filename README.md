This Repo is the smart contract of 'Patients help patients DAO' which offers users to mint their decentralized health identity (DHID). 
'PatHient' is the decentralized community-owned health data asset bank.

### DHID-contract
This is based on ERC-721. The DHID is only owned by the original holder which means it's not tradable like Soulbound token. It's similar to the health insurance card but there's no personal information in the DHID. 
  
### ERC6551-data NFT asset
This is based on ERC-6551. The data NFT asset is belong to the DHID NFT which is a kind of wallet, and the data NFT asset is the token in the wallet. The asset can be invested, curate, trade, etc. But the (data NFT) asset is not able to transfer to others because the health data is belong to patients. Patients can upload data and mint it as the NFT which belong to the wallet - DHID. Now this part is still in developing.
